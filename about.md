<p class=”lead”>Hello! I’m a full-stack developer located in [Chico, California, USA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chico,+CA/@39.7578412,-121.8409199,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80831f8dfc236487:0x308eeb8f793a4538).<p>

I was inspired to build for the web in 2009. That inspiration led to an internship with Learning Change, a small web development company in my home town. We merged in 2011-12 with [Matson & Isom Technology Consulting](www.mitcs.com) where I took a more development-focused role while simultaneously attending classes at CSU Chico. I continued to develop websites and applications build on WordPress, Drupal, Shopify, and a few custom platforms, until mid 2016 when I left to attend [Hack Reactor](www.hackreactor.com).
