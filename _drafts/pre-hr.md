Topics (in no particular order):

- A bit of background on my education and career?
- I won’t be moving to SF. I’ll be staying in Chico, CA. This means I won’t be writing about job hunting in SF (or house hunting); I’ll be writing about remote job hunting from Chico, CA.
- HR posts will be once per week on Sundays. The first will be on X and the last will be on Y.
- You can tweet any questions you have to me @cashweaver and I’ll answer them that Sunday.
